Vulnerability Score Service

This service calculates security scores for Solana validators based on:
- Open ports detected by port scanning (-5 points per unique port)
- Vulnerabilities found by vulnerability scanning (-15 points per vulnerability)

Starting score: 100 points
Final score = 100 - (open_ports_count * 5) - (vulnerabilities_count * 15)

The service creates a TimescaleDB hypertable to store historical security scores.
